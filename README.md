# Building-our-DeFi-Empire

Welcome to DeFi Kingdoms! This repository contains the necessary resources and guides to set up your own decentralized finance (DeFi) game similar to DeFi Kingdom.

## Getting Started

To get started with setting up your own DeFi Kingdom clone, follow the steps outlined below:

### 1. Set up your EVM subnet

Use our provided guide and refer to Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network. This subnet will serve as the foundation for your game's smart contracts and transactions.

### 2. Define your native currency

Define and set up your own native currency, which will act as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone. This currency will be utilized for various in-game transactions and interactions.

### 3. Connect to Metamask

Connect your EVM subnet to Metamask, a popular Ethereum wallet and gateway to decentralized applications (dApps). Follow the steps outlined in our provided guide to seamlessly connect your subnet to Metamask.

### 4. Deploy basic building blocks

Utilize Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts, and Remix, an online Solidity IDE, to deploy the basic building blocks of your game. These include smart contracts for battling, exploring, trading, and more. These contracts will define the game rules, manage liquidity pools, create tokens, and facilitate various interactions within the game.
